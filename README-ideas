include with each chord type, a list of the chord members, such as root, third, fifth

to that end, make each chord type an object

---

when drill is running, have a structure that keeps track of
root+voicing, to make sure it doesn't present the same one
until it exhausts them (and define what "them" means)
SO we need a way to mark, and a way to check.
