The goal of diatonic quiz is to have random questions, of 3 kinds,
like:

  what is the IIIm7 of key of C maj? (answer Em7)
  in what key is Em7 the IIIm7? (answer C)
  what function is Em7 in the key of C maj? (answer IIIm7)

So, there are three variables, the key, the function and the chord,
and all three questions ask for one of them given the other two.
