the following rules will work when the chords fall
unaltered in the same scale, if they don't, modifications
might have to be made on a case-by-case basis.

there are six possible root movements, and the consequent
notes moving are listed:

up a second  3rd,5th,7th fall one step
down a second  r,3rd,5th rise one step

up a fourth  5th,7th fall one step
down a fourth  r,3rd rise one step

up a sixth   7th falls one step
down a sixth   r rises one step
